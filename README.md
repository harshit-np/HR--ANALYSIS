# HR-ANALYSIS-
Steps for Applied Machine Learning (ML) for Hackathons :
Understand the Problem Statement & Import Packages and Datasets.

Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) - Understanding the Datasets :

Explore Train and Test Data and get to know what each Column / Feature denotes.
Check for Imbalance of Target Column in Datasets.
Visualize Count Plots & Unique Values to infer from Datasets.
Check Duplicate Rows from Train Data if present.

Fill/Impute Missing Values Continuous - Mean/Median/Any Specific Value & Categorical - Others/ForwardFill/BackFill.

Feature Engineering

Feature Selection - Selection of Most Important Existing Features.
Feature Creation - Creation of New Feature from the Existing Features.
Split Train Data into Predictors(Independent) & Target(Dependent).

Data Encoding - Label Encoding, OneHot Encoding and Data Scaling - MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler, RobustScaler
Create Baseline ML Model for Binary Classification Problem.
Improve ML Model with Voting Classifier with MODEL Evaluation METRIC - "F1" and Predict Target "is_promoted".
Result Submission, Check Leaderboard & Improve "F1" Score
